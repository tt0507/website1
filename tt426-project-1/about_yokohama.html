    <p class="about_yokohama_v1"> Until commander Matthew Perry arrived in 1854, Yokohama was a small village for fisher. Then it was opened to the world, becoming the first harbor city introduced in Japan. Since its openning, Yokohama has been incorportating new cultures and information from foreign countries. Yokohama is considered as the birthplace for modern Japan. The streets in Yokohama has been heavily influced by European culture.</p>

    <p class="about_yokohama_v1"> Yokohama is a city of art and culture where new urban values and fascination continue to be generated through the creativity given by such art and culture. What is so special about Yokohama is its success in collaborating with stylishness in various periods in history which is well exampled not only in the international museums or unique objects placed in the parks naturally incorporated with the harbor cityscape, but also its efforts to respect and reserve Japanese traditional popular arts. We continue to endeavor to provide various opportunities to artists and creators for their presentations by establishing and reinforcing cultural facilities such as museums, classical music hall or Noh (Japanese traditional masked dance-drama) theaters, and utilizing local resources of warehouses and historical buildings, which will, we firmly believe, also bring economic revitalization to our city.</p>
