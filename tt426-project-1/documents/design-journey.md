## Milestone 1

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class. You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)

The intended audience of my website are people who are interested in visiting Yokohama but do not have the necessary information about the famous/must-visit spots in Yokohama. The website could target tourists for various needs: shopping, eating, visiting and etc.

### Feel and Features (Milestone 1)
[Briefly describe the feel and features your site will have to cater to those audiences.]

To attract the target audience, I plan to include features such as hyperlinks within the website to provide more space for visuals and descriptions about the place. I also want to theme my website as as blue because the theme color of Yokohama is blue. When the audience visits my website, I want my audience to be exposed to the culture and experience unique to Yokohama; they feel like they are in Yokohama.

### Final Content (Milestone 1)

[Briefly describe the content you plan to include in the final submission, and why it's the right content for those audiences.]

For the final submission I plan to include to 3 sections about Yokohama: places to go, things to do(events) according to season, about Yokohama(History of Yokohama). Each page will have 3-4 parts which will provide more information about the page. For example for the *places to go* section, there are three extra links which provide detailed information about the famous tourists sites at Yokohama. I chose the three category because it provides useful and attractive information for tourists visiting Yokohama. Assuming that the tourists do not know anything about Yokohama, my website provides options for both short and long stays for visitors as it supplies them with various information.


## Milestone 2

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Target Audience (Milestone 2)

[A clearer description of audience: who are they, what are they interested in with respect to this site, and what are the design goals for that audience.]

Similar to milestone 1, the intended audience for my websites are people who are interested to visit Yokohama for vacations. People who visit my website will be interested in the tourism aspect of Yokohama as the website locates several tourist destination for both short and long stay. For my target audience, I decided to make design in a way such that it is easy to navigate. Since users would want information relatively easily, creating a website where information can easily be find is better for the users.

### Site Theme (Milestone 2)

[A description of your overall site theme and why it's appropriate for the audience.]

My overall theme color of my website will be a mix of bluish color and white because blue is the color that represents Yokohama since it was a harbor. I also may include shapes such as squares and triangles to represent Yokohama has a city. For fonts I want to mix old-looking fonts and modern-looking fonts to show that Yokohama is a city that is a mixture of past and present. This would be appropriate for the target audience as feel like they are already visiting Yokohama.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)

[A description of how you generated and considered alternatives for the site's navigation.]

My navigation of my website consists of three parts which are places to go page, things to do page, and about Yokohama page. I changed my original index page and added another places to go page to make the formatting same for all other pages. Each page has the option to go back to either the home page(index.html), places to go page, and things to do page. I have made these changes because I thought navigation within the website will be easier.

### Organization (Milestone 2)

[An explanation of how you came to the organization and content that you chose.]

I organized my website into three section: Things to do according to season, places to go, and a short history of Yokohama. I chose those three contents because the first two pages are necessary for tourists to identify the places they should visit. The last page about history is to give a short introduction to the Yokohama to provide them a better understanding of how the city of Yokohama became the place it is today. The organization of the website come to its current way because I thought that it would be easier for the users to navigate themselves through the website.

## Milestone 3

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Changes from Milestone 2 (Milestone 3)

[What changes did you make from Milestone 2 to content/information/navigation, and why?]

From milestone 2, I mainly changed the navigation bar and content on some page. From the navigation bar I made sure that the user can navigate through the important pages of my website. I made this change so that users can easily access information across my website. In terms of content, I added more information to some pages such as the about_yokohama.html page, and added a picture on my home page for the v2.css design. I made such changes to add more content so that the users can enjoy more of my website.

### Visual Design (Milestone 3)

[Discuss your visual designs: how did you come to them, what are their strengths and weaknesses, how do they fit your overall design goals and audiences?]

For both my design, v1.css and v2.css, I made blue my theme color. For my first design I tried to make a simple design without using any shapes. I centered most of the elements on the page to create symmetry. v2.css makes use of more shapes and colors compared to v1.css. For both designs, I tried to make the places_to_go page more distinct compared to the others as it lacked content. The strength of both design is I incorporated shapes, colors and typography to create a design. On the other hand, a improvement I can make is the formatting of the website. By making the formatting more unique, I think my website could attract more users. I think both design fit my overall design goal as I used blue as my theme color, and it also allows the audience to grasp what it feels like being in Yokohama.

### Emotion (Milestone 3)

[Emotion is a big part of design. What emotions where you thinking about or trying to convey in your designs?]

Since my website is a tourism website, I wanted to convey the emotions of adventure and nostalgia. Because the website is designed for someone who never visited Yokohama, creating an adventurous emotion for the website encourages the users to visit Yokohama. Some parts to Yokohama, is very similar to old buildings in western society due to their influences; therefore, creating a sense of nostalgia can also attract tourists.

## Final Submission - Rationale

This rationale should be polished writing: one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section run several paragraphs (1-3). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during user testing and how you addressed them. Quotes from your users during testing are also very powerful when explaining your rationale.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier rationales.

### Changes from Milestone 3 (Final Submission)

- Changes since Milestone 3 and why, particularly ones you learned from testing.

I have changed the format of the navigation bar from milestone 3 as I realized from testing that the navigation was did not have consistency and was confusing the users. To avoid such confusion, I decided to create a navigation bar that is located at the top of the website, and made sure that all page followed the same formatting. I changed the navigation bar from vertical to horizontal for some pages so that the user can use the navigation easily.

Another change I made from milestone 3 is the format of the texts. For some pages I had centered texts, whereas for others I had texts that were left-aligned. To fix such inconsistency, I decided to make all texts centered except for pages which had a lot of text(paragraphs). The reason I did not center texts for pages such pages, for example the about Yokohama page, was because the page was broken into several parts compared to other pages on my website. Due to this feature, not centering the text looked visually better.

### Audience (Final Submission)

[A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.]

The intended audience of my website is for people with specific needs: people who are planning to visit Yokohama, or people who wants to have information about the tourist destinations at Yokohama. My intended audience can serve for both people because the two audience would want similar information about Yokohama. The audience would probably want general information such as background information on Yokohama or the tourist destinations; therefore, they would not be very familiar with information about Yokohama.

The age range of my audience would be from all range because I have included several events and tourist destinations which can appeal to people from different age and different backgrounds. For gender, the website is made for both men and women as anyone can visit Yokohama. However, since traveling is a luxury for many, the target audience will be people who are considered more of a wealthy person or family.

### Design Goals (Final Submission)

[An explanation of the design goals for that audience, based on your earlier rationales.

As stated in the previous rationales, I wanted to create a website that was easy to navigate; therefore, I made my website very simple. To make the website aesthetically simple, I used mainly two colors: blue and white. This allowed me to create a website that is visually pleasing but not very fancy; another effect the color has on the user is that the visuals allows the users to read the content for a longer time due to implementing a simple color design.

For the design of the website I also made it simple by not including shapes or any fancy design. Since I wanted to make my website easy for the users to use, excluding unnecessary achieves this goal. I centered most of the elements of the pages to avoid leaving a lot of space on one side the page. I believe this makes the website visually more pleasing as symmetry is used for many designs. For the places to go page, I decided to create a design that differs from the other page to make the page more entertaining because the page lacks content compared to other pages. Including pictures of the places allows the users to imagine the mood and visualize the place.

### Navigation (Final Submission)

[An explanation of how the final navigation met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).]

For the navigation bar, I have included a link to the home page, places to go page, things to do page, and the about Yokohama page. The navigation bar met my goals because I have created a simple website navigation system that allows the users to locate information. The color of my navigation bar also contrasts with the website, making the navigation system more appealing and easier to see.

The navigation bar is appropriate for my audience because constructing the navigation bar in such way organizes my website in a manner that appeals to the users. Such navigation meets my goal for a tourism website because the users would need to locate information faster, and allow the user to only require a short amount of time. In addition, because the navigation is simple the visitors will easily manage to find the information they need.

### Organization (Final Submission)

[An explanation of how the final organization met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).]

For my final website, I have organized it into three section: places to go, things to do such as events, and a short history of Yokohama. The main focus of my website is the first two sections because the site targets tourists who wants or plans to visit Yokohama. The purpose of the last section is to give the tourists some background information on Yokohama. This allows the visitors to have a better understanding of how Yokohama became the city it is today, and understanding the connection between western culture and the places that I have included in my website.

Such organization is appropriate for the audience because it covers the important aspects of tourism. Each section contains important and useful information for the users which can significantly improve the quality of the visit if they ever do. Furthermore, including only three sections allows the users to easily navigate throughout the website; thus, allowing the users to get useful information quicker.


### Visual Design (Final Submission)

[An explanation of how the final design met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).]

For the final design, I decided to use my first design as my final product. The reason was because I got feedback that the first design was easier to follow and the visuals were more organized. Since I had a lot of free space for my second design, the first design seemed more natural because it was centered. Another feedback I got was that the colors for my first design fitted better because it used less flashy colors which made the design easier to see for the users.

The design is also appropriate for the audience because the design uses a mix of the color blue and white. As stated in the other milestone, I used blue because it is the color that represents Yokohama as a harbor city. The users can feel as if they are already at Yokohama by the blue color. Furthermore, I also incorporated the color white because it shows a good contrast with blue. I wanted to represent Yokohama as a bright and outgoing city, and the combination of white and blue achieves the goal.
